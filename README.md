# Associative Arrays in Dart Javascript Lua PHP Python Ruby and Rust CS315
Associative Arrays in Dart, Javascript, Lua, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Rust

In this homework assignment, you the associative array data structures provided in seven
different programming languages are investigated: Dart, Javascript, Lua, PHP, Python, Ruby and Rust. You will
investigate how the following operations are done in these programming languages:

1. Initialize
2. Get the value for a given key
3. Add a new element
4. Remove an elemet
5. Modify the value of an existing element
6. Search for the existence of a key
7. Search for the existence of a value
8. Loop through an associative array, apply a function, called foo, which simply prints the key-value
pair
